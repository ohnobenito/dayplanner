**Overview:**
As a person with a busy schedule, I wanted to create a simple daily planner that can be used during the work day to help manage time more effectively. 

This simple planner displays the date at the top of the page, and has time blocks for typical business hours where one can input their tasks to be completed and then save it so it stores the information even when the browser closes.

**The following tasks were done to meet the needs of the project:**
* Utilized Moment.js and Jquery to run date and time functions
* Page uses local storage to save user input that loads on the page when refreshed and clears it out when erase button is clicked
* Code uses Moment.js to determine time of day, and uses CSS to change color of time blocks based on past, present, or future
* Incorporated Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts to display a clean, responsive, and styled site

### **Technologies Used:**
- Moment.js
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- FontAwesome
- Google Fonts
